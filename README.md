# Ateneo-P2P-Public

Ateneo P2P+ is a conceptual website designed to improve the seat reservation system for Ateneo de Manila University's point to point shuttle service. The site provides a platform for users to reserve slots on shuttle trips to and from Ateneo, as well as a panel for the school admin to regulate the transport system.

A demo of the site is up on http://ateneo-p2p.herokuapp.com/.
